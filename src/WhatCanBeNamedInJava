The things we will name is Java are:
1. Packages
2. Classes
3. Interfaces
4. Methods
5. Constants
6. Variables
7. Type Parameters
_______________________________________________________
Packages: (Are the way of grouping related classes and interfaces together, easy to navigate through the project, Classes within the package can have unrestricted access to one another
            while still restricted access for classes outside the package).
- are always lowe case.
- should have unique names
- internal domain name reversed as a prefix for packages ( java.lang, java.io, org.xml.sax.helpers, com.timbuchalka.autoboxing )
- any invalid characters in domain name (/, \, - etc..) should be replaced with an _underscore (Experts-exchange.com --> com.experts_exchange)
- domain name components starting with a number should instead start with an _underscore (1world.com --> com._1world)
- domain name components that are Java keywords should should have that component start with _underscore ( Switch.supplier.com --> com.supplier._switch ) switch is a java keyword

Class Names:
- are CamelCase
- should be nouns
- starts with a capital letter and each word in the name should be capital (e.g. LinkedList)
- examples: ArrayList, GearBox ......

Interfaces:
- Cap like class names (CamelCase).
- Consider what object implementing the interface will become of what they will be able to do.

Methods:
- mixedCase
- Often verbs
- Reflect the function performed or the result returned.
- examples: .size(), .getName(), .addPlayer() ....

Constants: (Are used to define a value that never changes)
- ALL UPPER_CASE
- separate words with _ underscore
- declared using the final keyword
- ( Static final int MAX_INT, Static final short SEVERITY_ERROR, Static final double PI

Variable/field names:
- mixedCase
- start with lower case
-  do not use _ underscore
- examples: ( String myName = "name"; int myIntegerNumber = 234; char myFirstNameInitial = 'F'; )
